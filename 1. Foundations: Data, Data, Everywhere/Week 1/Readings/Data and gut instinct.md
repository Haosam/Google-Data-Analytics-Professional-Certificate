Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. Ask questions and define the problem.
2. Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
3. Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. Share data with your audience.
6. Act on the data and use the analysis results.

But for data analysts, just trusting our gut instinct can be a problem. At the heart of data-driven decision making is data, so we always want to focus on the data to ensure that we’re making informed decisions. When we make decisions based on our gut instinct without any data to back it up, it can lead to mistakes. Or worse, when we ignore the data based on our own personal experiences, we can create bias in our analysis. Businesses that rely on gut instinct to make decisions often make bad choices because they aren’t considering the story their data is actually telling. 

### Data + business knowledge = mystery solved

Blending facts and data with your business knowledge will be a common part of your process. The key is figuring out the exact mix of data and business knowledge for each particular project. A lot of times it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

Successful analysis needs to be accurate, and fast enough to help decision-makers. So try asking yourself these questions about a project:

- What kind of results are needed?
- Who will be informed?
- Am I answering the question being asked?
- How quickly does a decision need to be made?
For example, if you are working on a rush project, you might need to rely on your own knowledge and experience more than usual. There just isn’t enough time to thoroughly analyze all of the available data. But if you get a project that involves plenty of time and resources, then the best strategy would be to be more data-driven. It’s up to you, the data analyst, to think about the situation and make the best possible choice. You will probably blend facts and knowledge a million different ways over the course of your data analytics career. And the more you practice, the better you will get at finding that perfect blend.
