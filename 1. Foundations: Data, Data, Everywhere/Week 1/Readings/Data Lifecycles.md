## EMC's data analysis life cycle
EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
2. Pre-processing data
3. Model planning
4. Model building
5. Communicate results
6. Operationalize

EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats. Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and don’t start modeling before the data is ready. It is a little different from the data analysis life cycle this program is based on, but it has some core ideas in common: the first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions; data has to be prepared before it can be analyzed and used; and then findings should be shared and acted on.

## SAS' iterative life cycle
An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Their life cycle has seven steps, many of which we have seen in the other models, like Ask, Prepare, Model, and Act. But this life cycle is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again. 

## Project-based data analytics life cycle 
A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:

1. Identifying the problem
2. Designing data requirements
3. Pre-processing data
4. Data analysis
5. Data visualizing

This data analytics project life cycle was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or what we have been referring to as the Act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps as the life cycles we have already described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

## Big data analytics life cycle
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning 
6. Data aggregation and representation
7. Data analysis
8. Data visualization
9. Utilization of analysis results

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models. But in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.

## Data life cycle based on research
One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight phases:

1. Generation
2. Collection
3. Processing
4. Storage 
5. Management
6. Analysis
7. Visualization
8. Interpretation

This version includes storage, management, and interpretation phases, and excludes the Act phase that has appeared in other models.
